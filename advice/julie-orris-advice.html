                <h4>Creating a Habit</h4>
                <p>Whenever I'm trying to start something new, I figure out how to blend it into my daily routine. The more that I can interact with the new skill, activity or hobby, the easier it is for me to learn or keep up. </p>

                <p>I recommend finding a time each day to set aside for the thing I want to practice. If I can set aside 30 minutes in the morning, then I make the committment to doing it every morning. Whether it is morning, afternoon or evening, try to pick the same time everyday. Commit to atleast 30 minutes of it - long enough to get you into it, but short enough that you can pause if you're exhausted.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
